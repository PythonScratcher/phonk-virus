# phonk-virus
phonk "virus" writen in python 
makes the screen shake and go monochrome, with phonk music and a phonk image (like a yt short)  

i've tested it on windows, who knows what else it works on

put phonk images in photo/ and put phonk music in music/  
it will last the duration of the music, try to keep it .mp3 and .png, i have not tested other types.

## setup:
1. install python 
2. run `pip install pillow pygame pynput`
3. download the github repo and get into the same folder as it
4. run `python3 phonk.py`
